# UNEP-CCC Certificate Verification System

**Version 1.1** · Public certificate verification for webinar attendance certificates issued by the [UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre](https://unepccc.org/).

🔗 **Live system:** [unepccc.github.io/cert-verify](https://unepccc.github.io/cert-verify/)
📊 **Statistics:** [unepccc.github.io/cert-verify/stats.html](https://unepccc.github.io/cert-verify/stats.html)

---

## Overview

This repository hosts a static, publicly accessible certificate verification service. When UNEP-CCC issues a Certificate of Attendance for a webinar, a corresponding JSON record is published here automatically. Anyone can verify the authenticity of a certificate by entering the Certificate ID or scanning the QR code printed on the document.

The system is deliberately static — there is no backend server, no database, and no live connection to UN internal systems. This ensures long-term reliability, auditability, and minimal maintenance.

---

## How It Works

```
Attendee registered in SharePoint
      ↓
Power Automate triggers automatically
      ↓
Certificate ID generated · QR code created · Word template populated
      ↓
PDF generated and emailed to attendee
      ↓
Power Automate pushes updated certificates.csv to GitHub
      ↓
GitHub Action runs automatically (~30 seconds)
      ↓
JSON file published · stats.json updated
      ↓
Certificate live on public verification page
```

The entire process from SharePoint entry to live certificate verification is fully automatic — no manual steps required.

## Certificate ID Format

```
UNEPCCC-WEB-YYYY-NNNNNN
```

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `UNEPCCC` | Issuing organisation |
| `WEB` | Certificate type (webinar) |
| `YYYY` | Year of issuance |
| `NNNNNN` | Six-digit random number |

---

## JSON Data Model

Each certificate is stored as a single JSON file named `<CertificateID>.json`:

```json
{
  "certificateId": "UNEPCCC-WEB-2026-092206",
  "firstName": "Aristeidis",
  "lastName": "Tsakiris",
  "webinarTitle": "Maritime Decarbonization: A Critical Component of the Global Climate Action Agenda",
  "webinarDate": "24 April 2025",
  "dateIssued": "17 April 2026, 16:12:00 (UTC+02)",
  "status": "Valid"
}
```

**Status values:**

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Valid` | Certificate is authentic and current |
| `Revoked` | Certificate has been revoked by UNEP-CCC |

> Revoked certificates retain their JSON file — they are never deleted. The `status` field is updated to `"Revoked"` and the file is republished.

---

## Verification States

The public page shows exactly one of three states:

| State | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| ✅ **Valid** | JSON file exists and `status` is `"Valid"` |
| ⚠️ **Revoked** | JSON file exists and `status` is `"Revoked"` |
| ❌ **Not Found** | No JSON file exists for this Certificate ID |

---

## Verification Page Features

- **Four languages** — English, French, Spanish, Chinese (中文)
- **Auto-verify on load** — direct links via `?cert=UNEPCCC-WEB-YYYY-NNNNNN` verify instantly
- **Verified-on timestamp** — shows exact date and time of verification with animated indicator
- **Print / Save Certificate** — generates a print-ready certificate with QR code and verification timestamp, matching the original PDF layout
- **Share button** — native OS share sheet on mobile, clipboard copy on desktop

---

## Statistics Page

A public statistics page is available at [/stats.html](https://unepccc.github.io/cert-verify/stats.html) showing:

- Total certificates issued, valid, and revoked
- Total number of webinars
- Certificates issued by year (bar chart)
- Breakdown per webinar with status badges

Statistics are regenerated automatically by the GitHub Action on every CSV update — no manual maintenance required.

---

## Automated Pipeline

Certificates are published automatically via Power Automate:

1. A new item is created in the SharePoint certificates list
2. Power Automate generates the Certificate ID, QR code, and PDF
3. The PDF is emailed to the attendee with a direct verification link
4. Power Automate appends the new row to `certificates.csv` via the GitHub API
5. The GitHub Action detects the change and generates the JSON file and updated statistics

**No manual CSV export or file upload is required.**

---

## Manual Update (Fallback)

If the automated pipeline is unavailable, certificates can be published manually:

1. Export the certificate list from SharePoint as `certificates.csv`
2. Remove the `Email` and any internal columns before uploading
3. Upload/replace `certificates.csv` in this repository root
4. The GitHub Action runs automatically and regenerates all files

**The CSV must contain these columns** (exact names, case-sensitive):

| Column | Example |
|--------|---------|
| `CertificateID` | `UNEPCCC-WEB-2026-092206` |
| `First Name` | `Aristeidis` |
| `Last Name` | `Tsakiris` |
| `WebinarTitle` | `Maritime Decarbonization...` |
| `Webinar Date` | `4/24/2025` |
| `DateIssued` | `4/17/2026 4:12 PM` |
| `Status` | `Valid` or `Revoked` |

---

## Revoking a Certificate

1. In SharePoint, change the certificate's `Status` to `Revoked`
2. The automated pipeline will update the JSON file automatically, or
3. Export and upload `certificates.csv` manually as a fallback
4. The verification page will immediately show the Revoked state

> Do **not** delete JSON files to revoke a certificate. Always use the `Revoked` status.

---

## System Design Principles

- **No backend** — fully static, hosted on GitHub Pages
- **No APIs** — no live connection to UN internal systems
- **Automated** — Power Automate pushes directly to GitHub on every certificate issuance
- **Auditable** — full change history in Git
- **Resilient** — works indefinitely with no infrastructure to maintain
- **Privacy** — email addresses and internal notes are never published

---

## Versioning

| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| v1.0 | Static verification, no revocation support |
| v1.1 | Revocation-aware, automated pipeline, print/share, statistics (current) |

Minor versions = behavioural changes · Major versions = architectural changes
